Note: probably works only on linux












## features TODO
- [x] bencode decoder
- [x] parse torrent file
- [x] calculate info hash
- [x] get peers with tracker
- [x] download
    - [x] tcp connection
    - [x] handshakes
    - [x] messages
    - [x] pieces
    - [x] managing connections and pieces
    - [x] downloading pieces
- [x] writing pieces to files
    - [x] single files
    - [x] multi files
- [ ] seeding (too lazy to implement)
- [x] resume downloads (for single file downloads) 
- [x] display percetege downloaded (needs the loading bar)
- [x] cli options: download_dir, torrent_file,



## extra features to implement
- [ ] remove clients when they error and refresh and add clients periodically (stop client threads, refresh peers and start new clients)
- [ ] recovery from all types of errors and disconnections (no unwraps in this app should be left)
- [ ] no reliance on announce (implementing DHT)
- [ ] magnet links
- [x] when download is interrupted pick off where it started (read the local files that are downloaded already)(remove them from the PieceWorkers Vector)
- [x] rework getting peers from the tracker (not using udp tho)
- [ ] download multiple torrents


## Errors:
- [ ] sometimes near the end of the download the programme uses 100% of CPU (cant reproduce) 
- [x] when reading already downloaded pieces they are not added to the progress
- [x] fix the connection drop logic its broken 
- [x] checking pre existing pieces ignore pieces shared between files 
- [x] final piece smaller than usual isnt detected in the already downloaded (solved by reading by the piece size not the default piece length (eg. 32768)) (not solved only for the last piece of single file downloads) (implemented a solution but was very ugly and messy for a very small issue)
- [x] resuming download reader.rs still has some issues (probably when all pieces are downloaded)
```
thread 'main' panicked at src/download/download.rs:46:72:
called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: "failed to fill whole buffer"
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```
- [x] restart clients (clients keep breaking with): 
  - Resource temporarily unavailable (os error 11) ---> (message.rs line:107)
  - failed to fill whole buffer ---> (message.rs line:127)
  - Broken pipe (os error 32) ---> (when trying to write to a closed socket)
- [x] receiving pieces in the wrong order "expected index: 44, got: 9" (used to get this error but not anymore idk why)
- [x] when the last piece is finished downloading the receiving MSCP channel throws "error receiving in the receiver thread: receiving on a closed channel"
- [x] insane CPU usage almost 100% (i5 8600k):
```rust
// this one was caused because of this code block which was ran everytime we received a PIECE message from a peer
// the CPU consumption is still a bit high and can be lowered but thats not a priority right now
// NOTE: this was discovered thanks to flamegraph profiler (https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph)
progress.buf.splice((buf_begin as usize).., res_buf);
let mut file = std::fs::OpenOptions::new()
    .write(true)
    .append(true)
    .open("buffers.txt")
    .unwrap();

writeln!(file, "{:?}", res_buf).unwrap();
```







## to fix (not errors)
- [x] some Peers responses come out as binary instead of text of Ip addresses (maybe change it to udp (https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0015.html))

it seems to be that getting peers from trackers is usually done with HTTP and not UDP, but some torrents return the response as an invalid bencode message

```

could be that the binary data is bytes for ip.ip.ip.ip:port 6bytes total (this is correct)

- [x] refactor the "download" folder
- [x] refactor and improve naming 
- [x] divide code to more functions for better testing
- [x] add connection resets in case of connection errors
- [x] send piece result to a writer thread with MSCP channels
- [ ] add documentation
- [ ] add all errors handling (remove all .unwrap())
- [ ] add all components tests
